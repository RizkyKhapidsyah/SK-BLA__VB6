Raw 001
-------
Format : 001 :Welcome to the Internet Relay Network <nickname>
Example: 001 :Welcome to the Internet Relay Network Gemini
Network: All

Parameters
----------
<nickname>	Your nickname.

Info
----
Sent to all clients once a connection has been established and the user has successfully registered.

Notes
-----
This is the first point where a script or client can be sure that the user's connection has been accepted without errors or problems.

This reply is sent once upon connection automatically, and never again during an IRC session.

Variations
----------
On many networks (such as Dalnet) the user's full address will be given instead of just a nickname, for example-

001 :Welcome to the Internet Relay Network Gemini!zodiac@port123.stupid.com

Also, many networks change the message itself to include the network's name in the message, for example-

001 :Welcome to the DALnet IRC Network pai!goddess@21.9.234.32

You cannot be guaranteed that the network name or user's nickname will always be in the same position.

* u2.10.* - Undernet
* dal4.* - Dalnet
* 2.8* - Efnet
* 2.9.* - Ircnet

If you want to get the server version while you are connected, you can use VERSION.

Parameters
----------
<map>	A string showing the relative position of one server

Info
----
Sent to a user in reply to a MAP command. When a user requests a MAP, one line is sent for each server, and displaying all of the lines in a fixed width font will show a 'map' of how the servers are connected.

Notes
-----
The string is intended for user viewing- Although the format is consistent, you should probably not rely on it being in any given format.

Raw 005 - DALnet protocol
-------------------------
Format : 005 <protocols> :are available on this server
Example: 005 NOQUIT TOKEN WATCH=128 SAFELIST :are available on this server
Network: DALnet

Parameters
----------
<protocols>	A list of special features ("protocols") that the server supports.

Info
----
This is sent when you connect to a DALnet server, after the 004 reply.

Notes
-----
Some "protocols" that may appear here-

* NOQUIT- Reduces server-to-server bandwidth during splits. (no effect on users)
* TOKEN- Uses tokens to reduce server-to-server bandwidth. (no effect on users?)
* WATCH=128- Supports the WATCH command, with a 128 user limit.
* SAFELIST- Channel LISTs will be sent in chunks to reduce the chance of being disconnected.

The numeric for this may change in the future, as well as the possible features.

Raw 008
-------
Format : 008 <num> :: Server notice mask (<hex>)
Example: 008 1234 :: Server notice mask (0x4d2)
Network: Undernet

Parameters
----------

<hex>	The hexadecimal value of the server notice mask. (from 0x1 to 0x1fff)

Info
----
Sent to a user when they set or view their server notice mask.

Notes
-----
A server notice mask is a special extension of the +s user MODE on Undernet. It is viewed like any other user MODE, using the MODE command. To set it, you would type something such as-

MODE mynick +s 1234

The mask is 13 bits wide and determines which categories of server notices are sent to you.

Example: 211 irc1.sprynet.com 0 49243278 3327277 22095880 1208863 :134450
Network: All

Parameters
----------
<connection>	The connection or link name. May include a host or port mask in [brackets] after the server name or address.
<sendq>	Number of bytes that are buffered but unsent on this connection. (?)
<sentmsg>	Number of messages sent on this connection.
<sentbyte>	Number of bytes sent on this connection.
<recdmsg>	Number of messages received from this connection.
<recdbyte>	Number of bytes received from this connection.
<open>	Amount of time (in seconds?) this connection has been open.

Info
----
A series of these are sent in reply to a STATS l request. (lowercase L) They represent the ports and connections a server has available for users to connect to.

Notes
-----
This reply is not yet fully documented; If you have further information on the contents of this reply, please contact paiRC.

Advanced
--------
The primary use for this is selecting a good port to connect to your server. The port will usually be found in the connection parameter, within brackets, as the last token seperated by periods. For example, in "NewBrunswick.NJ.US.Undernet.Org[*.6669]" the port is 6669; in "irc.cs.cmu.edu[unknown@*@*.6666]" the port is 6666; in "irc1.sprynet.com[0.0.0.0.9999]" the port is 9999. If no brackets are found, the port is probably 6667. (the default port.) If no port is listed, then you should probably ignore that line. Also, if the brackets contain other specifics besides a port, you can probably assume that the port is reserved for certain users.

To determine the best port, you should find the port with the lowest traffic. This can usually be best estimated by adding together sentmsg and recdmsg or sentbyte and recdbyte. You may want to divide by the connection open time to get an average throughput.

Variations
----------
Like most STATS replies, the format of this reply can vary greatly from network to network. Some examples-

* DALnet

211 stlouis.mo.us.dal.net[*.7325] 0 1902 138 1290 24 1132 :0

211 viper.mo.us.dal.net[209.96.0.13] 0 21928 1062 166461 9935 1127 :0

* Undernet

211 NewBrunswick.NJ.US.Undernet.Org[*.6669] 0 106425518 9240002 20983702 1503812 :3240148

211 NewBrunswick.NJ.US.Undernet.Org[*@204.127.145.*.5832] 0 2307876 204111 161880 6159 :3240148

211 Ice_Age[12.69.75.157] 0 2 0 3 0 :22

211 [198.139.11.11] 0 0 0 0 0 :59

* EFnet

211 irc.cs.cmu.edu[unknown@*@*.6666] 0 14555473 1112048 3423266 153641 :1173564 1173564 -

211 irc1.sprynet.com[0.0.0.0.9999] 0 188077 20386 12894 848 :134450

As can be seen, the format of the connection parameter is where the most differences are found. Usually this is the name of your server, but on Undernet some lines exist without server names. Usually the name is followed by a mask in brackets. This mask may contain a mask to match against a user address, a port, or other details.

The sentmsg/recdmsg and sentbyte/recdbyte parameters may differ in actual calculation from server to server. Some servers may count sentbyte/recdbyte in kilobytes instead of bytes.

Also notice how DALnet servers and at least one EFnet server return additional data. On DALnet, the final parameter is actually idle time for that connection. (in seconds?) On EFnet the additional parameter seems to be a duplicate of the open parameter. (?)

As a final note, many networks send a header line before the actual replies, such as-

211 SendQ SendM SendBytes RcveM RcveBytes Open_since :Idle

Remember to account for this possibility when parsing replies.

A STATS o request lists O-lines, which determine which hosts are allowed to become IRC operators. A user must have both a userhost matching an O-line and the appropriate password to become an operator.

Thanks to Justin H for helping clear up some of this information.

A series of these are sent in reply to a STATS U request (uppercase U) on networks that support U-lines.

Notes
-----
A STATS U request lists U-lines, which give certain hosts special privledges. These privledges allow the changing of modes on channels without being an op on the channel or even on the channel. U-lines are used for special services intended for channel management or channel rescue and other related activities, such as UWorld on Undernet and ChanServ on DALnet.

U-lines are generally global to all servers on a network.

Info
----
Returned on some networks when the server has too much traffic to send a reply to a command.

Notes
-----
Although the text implies that it is the server's load in general that causes this reply, in practice it seems to be sent on a user-to-user basis when a user attempts to request too much information from a server. For example, if you attempt too many STATS requests in a short period of time, you will get this error.

Notes
-----
You can view another user's SILENCE list, but you will only see masks that your current server knows about. Your server will only know about an entry if someone matching that entry sent a message via your server to that person. For example, if a user has a *!*@*.aol.com entry and you are on AOL, message the user before checking their SILENCE list to be sure that your server knows about any silence list entries.

Network: Most

Parameters
----------
<nick>	Nickname of a user.
<away>	Information (provided by the user) on why he or she is (or was, for WHOWAS) away.

Info
----
This is sent to tell you that a given user is away. (set using the AWAY command.) It will be returned, if applicable, for a WHOIS or WHOWAS request, and also if you send a PRIVMSG to a user that is away.

Notes
-----
The away information is provided by the user and may contain anything.

This is sent, as a reminder, when you send a PRIVMSG to a user, but will not be returned for a NOTICE, INVITE, or any other sort of interation.

Example: 302 :Gamera=-keekee@dt091n15.san.rr.com pai=+pain@d2052192151.imsday.com
Network: All

Parameters
----------
<userhosts>	A series of USERHOST replies.

Info
----
This is returned in reply to a USERHOST request.

Notes
-----
Each reply is formatted as nickname=+userid@host. 'nickname' is the user's nickname, 'userid' is their userid (identd) and 'host' is their host address. + means that they are here (not away), and will be a - (hyphen) if they are away.

A USERHOST reply will contain from zero to five replies. When you send the USERHOST request you can include up to five nicks; the reply will only contain info on the nicks that exist, if any. If none of the nicks you requested exist, a blank reply will be returned.

Note that the USERHOST reply will contain the proper case for each nickname, regardless of the actual case used in the original request.

Variations
----------
Some networks allow more than five nicknames to be requested in a USERHOST request. If so, the USERHOST replies will be broken across multiple lines. (not sure if they are compacted five to a line or one line for each five nicks requested...?)

Undernet will return a 401 reply (no such nickname) for each user that you request a userhost for that does not exist. The USERHOST reply will still be returned with the missing users not present.

----
This is sent in reply to an ISON request. The reply contains all nicknames that are on IRC out of the set of nicknames originally requested. For example, if 'ISON a b c d' was sent, and b and d are on IRC, then this reply will return 'b d' for 'nicknames'.

Notes
-----
Note that the ISON reply will contain the proper case for each nickname, regardless of the actual case used in the original request.

If no nicknames are online from the requested list, a blank 303 reply is returned.

This reply is used by notify lists and features in most clients, including mIRC, so be careful when using this in a script.

Example: 307 :Spekkio=-Spekkio@209.86.144.138 T_A=-~tomandre@195.204.242.136
Network: Undernet

Parameters
----------
<userips>	A series of USERIP replies.

Info
----
This is returned in reply to a USERIP request.

Notes
-----
The main difference between this and USERHOST is that a numeric ip is always returned, even if the user has a resolved (normal) host.

Each reply is formatted as nickname=+userid@ip. 'nickname' is the user's nickname, 'userid' is their userid (identd) and 'ip' is their numeric ip. + means that they are here (not away), and will be a - (hyphen) if they are away.

A USERIP reply will contain from zero to five replies. When you send the USERIP request you can include up to five nicks; the reply will only contain info on the nicks that exist, if any. If none of the nicks you requested exist, a blank reply will be returned.

Note that the USERIP reply will contain the proper case for each nickname, regardless of the actual case used in the original request.

Also note that a 401 reply (no such nickname) will also be returned for each user that you request a USERIP for that does not exist. The USERIP reply will still be returned with the missing users not present.

<request>	The WHO request that was made.

Info
----
This is sent at the end of a WHO request.

Notes
-----
The 'request' parameter will be the exact query you sent, whether a single text string, wildcards, a channel, etc.

If a single WHO request returns information on multiple users or sets of users, this numeric is returned only once, at the end of all replies.

Although the other parts of a WHO reply contain the proper case of nicknames, channels, and other information, this reply will contain the case of the request exactly as you made it.

Network: All

Parameters
----------
<nick>	Nickname of a user you WHOIS'd.
<seconds>	Number of seconds user is idle.
<signon>	A timestamp representing when the user signed on to IRC.
<info>	A quick description of the previous two parameters.

Info
----
This is sent as part of a reply to a WHOIS request, if the user is on the same server as you. It includes the number of seconds the user is idle as well as when they signed on to IRC.

Notes
-----
Idle time is measured from the last time the user sent a PRIVMSG. No other commands will reset a user's idle time.

The signon time can be converted to a standard date and time using $asctime().

The 'info' parameter will not change from WHOIS to WHOIS, but it may differ between servers or networks. It exists solely to help document the purpose of the values in the reply.

Advanced
--------
Although this only appears when you are on the same server as a user, you can still get this information from another server. Simply send WHOIS user user (with the nickname listed twice, as shown) and the WHOIS reply will be sent from the user's server and not taken from the information on your current server.

Variations
----------
A few networks may not return the signon time, but just the idle time. Most major networks return both, however.

----

Notes
-----
Note that secret and private channels will not be listed.

This is the only part of a WHOIS reply that may appear multiple times for a given user. If a user is on a large number of channels, multiple 319 replies will be returned to contain all of the channels. This normally should not occur, except for special exceptions such as X and W on Undernet.

Advanced
--------
Some networks support the usermode +d, which makes a user "deaf", or unable to see channel text. If a user is deaf, all channels listed in the WHOIS reply will be prefixed with a -. (hyphen)

Variations
----------
Certain networks may return @+ prefixing a channel if the user is both opped and voiced on the channel.

Not all networks support deaf mode. (see advanced)

Info
----
This is returned by a WHO request, one line for each user that is matched.

Notes
-----
If the user is on multiple channels, only one will be returned. If the WHO was performed on a channel, this will always be the channel that was requested. Private and secret channels are not returned unless you are on them as well.

The flags will always start with H (here) if the user is not away, or G (gone) if the user is away. This is followed by a * (asterisk) if the user is an IRCop, then a @ or + if the user is opped or voiced on the listed channel. This is then followed by a d (lowercase) if the user is deaf, such as X and W on Undernet.

The hop count ('hops') is a count of the number of servers between your server and their server. If they are on your server, this will be 0. If they are on a server directly connected to your server, this is 1. If there is one intervening server, this is 2, etc.

Info
----
This is returned for a NAMES request for a channel, or when you initially join a channel. It contains a list of every user on the channel.

Notes
-----

Note that a NAMES reply for a channel you are not on will not include invisible users.

If a NAMES reply cannot fit into a single 353 reply, multiple replies are returned until all users are listed.

Advanced
--------
If a NAMES request returns only a 366 (end of NAMES) reply without any 353 replies, then the channel is secret or private, or does not exist.

If a NAMES request returns a single 353 reply that contains no nicknames, then the channel exists and is not secret or private, however all users on the channel are invisible.

Notes
-----
Remember that each server will be listed once in the 'server' section, but since 'hub' is the server connected to, some servers will be listed multiple times in that column, and some (that are not hubs) will not be listed at all.

The hop count will be 0 for your current server, 1 for servers directly connected to your server, 2 for servers that have one server between your server and them, etc.

Some servers do not include the hyphen at the beginning of MOTD replies, so you cannot rely on the actual text starting at the second word.

-----
The standard reply to MOTD uses 372 numerics, not 377. This numeric is sent by certain servers instead of 372 to bypass clients and scripts that hide the MOTD, among other reasons.

Note that often, if a nickname contains an invalid character, the server will just truncate it at the first invalid character and use it, instead of returning this error.

Variations
----------
On DALnet, attempts to use some nicknames will return an extended reply such as
